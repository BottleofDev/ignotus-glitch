### What am I currently working on?
<!-- An FAQ/Q&A? No, just saying what shit I'm doing, even tho no one cares... -->
#### > I'm workin on SPA[^1]/API called Glitch N3TW0RK, where I'll put most od my projects, like EsoScriptum - a tool for creating your own esolangs[^2].
#### > If you like games, especialy horror ones, then you could be intrested by this. I'm creating a Phasmofobia inspired game called `Glitch Hunt`, but it might take a while...
<!-- And mayybe it'll be my portfolio or some "about me" shit... heh -->
