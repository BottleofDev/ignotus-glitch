### What am I currently working on?
<!-- An FAQ/Q&A? No, just saying what shit I'm doing, even tho no one cares... -->
#### > I'm workin on SPA[^1] Terminum, where you'll be able to acces most of my projects, like EsoScriptum - a tool for creating your own esolangs[^2] (also it'll be it's own web app).
<!-- And mayybe it'll be my portfolio or some "about me" shit... heh -->
[^1]: Single Page App, unfortunetly not a place... xD
[^2]: "An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke."
