### What am I currently working on?
<!-- An FAQ/Q&A? No, just saying what shit I'm doing, even tho no one cares... -->
#### > I'm workin on SPA[^1] called EsoScriptum, where you'll be able to create your own esolang[^2].
#### > Also I'll be creating another SPA "Fun-Box", where you'll be playing with machine learning AI or finding some secrets in the terminal! (At least that's my plan)(it's code will be private... sorry)
#### > If you like games, especialy horror ones, then you could be intrested by this. I'm creating a backrooms themed game called Project: Noclip and it'll be available on `itch.io`.
<!-- And mayybe it'll be my portfolio or some "about me" shit... heh -->
[^1]: Single Page App, unfortunetly not a spa... xD
[^2]: "An esoteric programming language (sometimes shortened to esolang) is a programming language designed to test the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, as software art, as a hacking interface to another language (particularly functional programming or procedural programming languages), or as a joke."
